 I love technical blog posts, especially those that can take you through the entire process of building an app, A to Z. After reading thousands of technical blog posts and writing many myself, I’ve decided that it’s time to share a workflow that I hope will help those who are creating amazing things to blog more easily and often. The specific tools utilized in this workflow are Jekyll (gem library devloped in ruby) based, but the concepts can be applied to any toolchain.
